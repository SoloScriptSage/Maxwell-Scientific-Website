				<p class="desc"><span class="indent">Hi there, I'm Maxwell, and I have always been captivated by the wonders of science.</span>  After completing my studies in chemistry, I found myself yearning to share my passion with others. I taught at MHS for 10 years and was
frustrated by the lack of accessible science supplies. So one day, I decided to take matters into my own hands. 
With relentless determination, I founded <span class="italics">Maxwell Scientific School Supplies & More</span>, a haven for students and teachers in need of high-quality school science supplies and more. 
Through meticulous research, hard work, and a dash of entrepreneurial spirit, I brought my vision to life. 
Today, <span class="italics">Maxwell Scientific School Supplies & More</span> stands as a thriving hub in Marion, inspiring the scientific minds of tomorrow and empowering them to explore the wonders of the world around them.</p>
